### Introduction

This website was built with security in mind. Authentication is used to ensure that non-verified users cannot write to our database. Any user can read from our database. Built upon that was a design that is inviting while very simple without anything too crazy. Built in repsonsiveness was added as well.

Both implementations have general functions that can be used such as: take(n), drop(n), reverse(), reversed() for the immutable list, append(other), map(f), filter(p), last(), every(p), some(p)
